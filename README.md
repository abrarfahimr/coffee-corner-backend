## Description
This is the backend server for my fullstack capstone project at BrainStation called Coffee Corner. It is a dashboard for a startup company focused on selling different brands of coffee.The goal to help make better business decisions through dynamic data visualization and manage and maintain data on products and customers.

The project was built with two key areas of focus. Data management and Data visualization. Data management using CRUD operation And data visualization with graphs and charts to know how well the business is doing and find areas of high and low potential.

While working I came into some problems and areas of opportunity that I want to highlight from future sprints. First is an opportunity to dynamically update statistics as new transactions happen. Building for real time statistics such as that of salesforce is an important opportunity area to consider so users can immediately see major issues as soon as they happen. One functionality issue I found while creating the product page was the images being imported into a fake directory instead of a public library in the backend server
